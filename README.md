# ExpenseTracker
This is a command-line-based Expense Tracker using Python, utilizing the pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and basic analysis. The goal is to simulate a basic finance tool that allows users to upload or input expense records, and the program will return insightful summaries based on categories and amounts.
The data we have only used numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
This is a small trial version that consists of small data.


To run this program, you could use either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio.
You can download the code from the expense_tracker.ipynb file.
