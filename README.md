This is a command-line-based Expense Tracker using Python, utilizing the pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and basic analysis. The goal is to simulate a basic finance tool that allows users to upload or input expense records, and the program will return insightful summaries based on categories and amounts.
The data we have only used numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
This is a small trial version that consists of small data.
